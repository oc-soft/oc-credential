nodejs is signed with special system entitlement. When the app with it, you can not change DYLD_LIBARAY_PATH environement variables.

Here is description from System Integrity Progection Guide.


When a process is started, the kernel checks to see whether the main executable is protected on disk or is signed with an special system entitlement. If either is true, then a flag is set to denote that it is protected against modification. â€¦ Any dynamic linker (dyld) environment variables, such as DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, are purged when launching protected processes.
